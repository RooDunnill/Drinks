#Welcome to the Collabrative Drink Rater!
#Here you can rate the plethora of beverages you have from all around in ONE PLACE. Compare your ratings with friends and #find out your buddies favorite drinks.


#READ THIS:

#To make this colab easier for everyone I have just shared the Drinking file so the code runs through that. This is because all the code uses the RooDrink module made for the plotting and drink locating functions, but you can copy and change your own module as you please if you want to have more functions, or just add to the communal RooDrinky.py module!

#Just use the DrinkRater notebook I shared and it will be collaborative (hopefully)


#Have fun and enjoy the WACKINESS of the code! <3 Andrew
